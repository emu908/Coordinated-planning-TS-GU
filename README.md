# Data and Code for CAIE-D-25-05294

This project contains the code and corresponding data for manuscript No. CAIE-D-25-05294. The data are the preprocessed S-8-60 dataset derived from the original data. The code is divided into two parts:
	1.	the Gurobi-based implementation under Scenario S1; and
	2.	the TS-GU implementation under Scenarios S1, S1e, S2a, S2b, S3, and S4.

After running these codes on a local computer, the results reported in Section 5.2.3 can be reproduced. It is recommended to use Python 3.9, and the xlrd library version must be 1.2.
